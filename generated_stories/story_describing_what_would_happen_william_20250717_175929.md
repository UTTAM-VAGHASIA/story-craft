The orchard buzzed with bees and dappled light as William Shakespeare sat beneath his ancient apple tree, quill in hand. A crimson apple thudded onto his parchment, smudging his ink. He glared upward, where branches creaked like disgruntled audience members.  

“A pox on your timing!” he muttered, dabbing at the stain with his sleeve. “Must fate interrupt my tragedy of Hamlet’s soliloquy?”  

A voice chirped from the hedgerow: “Perhaps the apple’s a metaphor, master.”  

Shakespeare startled as his serving boy, Tom, emerged clutching a basket of pears. “Or a comedic device,” Tom added boldly. “The fruit’s absurdity mirrors Rosaline’s flighty heart.”  

“Metaphors won’t fill my coffers,” Shakespeare grumbled, though a smirk tugged his beard. The man who’d once penned *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* for coin now found himself trapped in this pastoral farce—Newton’s life! By morning, he’d been plucking apples instead of pens; by noon, debating gravity with disinterested sheep.  

Tom plopped beside him, scattering pears. “Why not write *of* this? A play about a poet turned orchard keeper—”  

“*Enough!*” Shakespeare stood abruptly, knocking over his inkwell. “I’m no Isaac Newton! I don’t solve cosmic riddles with falling fruit!”  

The words hung in the air like ripe apples waiting to drop. Tom frowned. “But you *do* make sense of human folly.”  

Silence hummed between them until Shakespeare sighed, slumped back against the trunk. “Perhaps… I’ve been so busy chasing kings and patrons that I forgot why I first picked up a quill—to catch truths as they tumbled from heaven.” He plucked a pear from Tom’s basket and bit into it sharply. “Tell me, lad—how might a man describe gravity to a world that thinks love and war are the only forces worth measuring?”  

Tom hesitated. “Maybe as… a silent stagehand who pulls all actors toward their tragic ends?”  

Shakespeare choked on pear juice, then barked a laugh—a rich sound that startled sparrows from their perches. “By Jove! You’ve given me my *Macbeth*!” He seized his notebook and began scribbling furiously under the tree: *“All the world’s a stage…”*  

When dusk fell on the orchard that night, servants carried lanterns past Shakespeare’s makeshift desk where he worked by candlelight.

“Another sonnet?” Tom asked drowsily.

“Nay—an epilogue,” Shakespeare murmured without looking up.* *And though some say gravity binds all matter,* ***I say ‘tis poetry that holds the stars together.***”
