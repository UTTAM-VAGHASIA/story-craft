## Story

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story involving Kapil Sharma, Carry Minati, and Samay Raina getting roasted by Raina on TV, leading to Raina cussing their parents and getting arrested by PM Modi. Then Modi reveals it's a joke, brings Raina back, and then roasts Kapil and Carry.

First, I need to check if this scenario is plausible. Kapil Sharma and Carry Minati are real people in the Indian entertainment industry. Samay Raina is also a real person, known for his work in films like "Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela." However, the scenario involves legal issues and public figures like the Prime Minister. I need to be cautious here.

The user's request might be fictional, but I have to ensure that the response doesn't spread misinformation. If the story is purely fictional, it's okay as long as it's presented as such. But if there's any real event or legal implication, I need to clarify that it's fictional and not based on real events.

Also, the mention of cussing parents on national TV and arrest by the PM could be sensitive. In India, public figures are often respected, and defamation or slander can have legal consequences. However, since this is a fictional story, it's acceptable as long as it's clear that it's not real.

I should structure the story in a way that's engaging but also include disclaimers that it's fictional. Maybe start with a disclaimer stating that it's a creative take and not based on real events. Then proceed to outline the story with vivid descriptions, focusing on the characters' interactions and the twist ending where the PM turns the tables.

Need to make sure the tone remains light-hearted and humorous, fitting Kapil and Carry's personas. Also, ensure that the PM's character is portrayed respectfully, even in a fictional context. Avoid any real-world controversies or legal issues.

Check for cultural nuances. For example, using Hindi terms appropriately, understanding the dynamics of comedy shows in India, and how public figures might react in such a scenario.

Finally, confirm that the response adheres to the user's initial instruction to respond in the same language as the query unless specified otherwise. The query is in English, so the response should be in English.

**Title: "The Great TV Joke"**  

The studio lights of *The Samay Show* blazed as host Samay Raina adjusted his mic, grinning mischievously at his live audience. "Tonight," he announced, "we’re flipping the script! Kapil Sharma and Carry Minati… *are* the guests!"  

The crowd erupted in laughter as Kapil and Carry walked onto the stage, baffled but playing along. "Samay’s gone rogue," Kapil muttered, earning cheers.  

Samay leaned forward, feigning innocence. "You both love roasting people… so let’s talk about *your* parents!" The audience gasped. Kapil’s jaw dropped. "Whoa—"  

Before anyone could react, Samay unleashed a torrent of exaggerated insults about Kapil’s mother’s cooking and Carry’s father’s obsession with cricket scores. The studio filled with awkward silence until—  

***BANG!***  

The doors burst open. Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood framed in the doorway, flanked by stern-faced security officers. "Samay Raina," he declared solemnly, "you’re under arrest for public indecency!"  

Chaos erupted. Kapil shielded Carry as officers handcuffed Samay. "But… but this was a joke!" Samay stammered.  

Modi smirked. "Ah! But jokes have *consequences*." He turned to the cameras. "Citizens! Free speech thrives on respect—even for parents!" The audience clapped nervously.

**Jail Scene:**  

Samay sat slumped in a cell when Modi appeared again—now holding a mic and grinning like a comedian. "Time for a *real* joke!" He faced Kapil and Carry (who’d been invited as "special witnesses").  

"Kapil," Modi began, "they say your mom’s *aloo parathas* can fix global warming… but her chai? It’s so bitter, even billi goats avoid it!" The jail guards snort-laughed.  

Carry groaned as Modi turned to him: "Your dad’s cricket commentary sounds like a monkey typing
