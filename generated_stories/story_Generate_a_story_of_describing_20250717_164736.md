**The Apple’s Whisper**  

William Shakespeare sat beneath the gnarled apple tree in his Cambridgeshire orchard, quill in hand, ink drying unnoticed on his parchment. Autumn leaves crunched under him, their earthy scent clashing with the tang of frustration. For weeks, his mind had been barren—a tragedy for a man who’d once birthed entire worlds from words.  

“Still wrestling with your muse, Will?” called Thomas Merlowe, Shakespeare’s sharp-tongued companion, leaning against the tree’s trunk. His grin was sly, but his eyes betrayed impatience. They’d both fled London’s plague-ridden streets for this quiet countryside, yet peace eluded Shakespeare.  

“I’ve written plays about kings and stars,” Shakespeare muttered, crumpling another page. “But this… this *gravity*… it’s not drama. It’s dust.”  

Merlowe snorted. “Dust? The heavens themselves—”  

A sudden *crack* interrupted him. An apple plummeted from above, striking Shakespeare’s forehead with a soft *thud*. He gasped, clutching his head as crimson bloomed in his hair.  

“Christ’s wounds!” Merlowe rushed over. “Are you struck mad?”  

Shakespeare stared at the fallen fruit rolling across his palm. Its skin glowed amber in the slanting sunlight. For a heartbeat, time suspended. Then his lips quirked—a mischievous glint reigniting in his eyes.  

“What if,” he breathed, “the apple isn’t falling *down*, but the sky is falling *up*? What if all things are bound by… by an invisible hand?”  

Merlowe blinked. “You’ve hit your head too hard.”  

But Shakespeare leapt up, scattering parchment. “Imagine! A force that pulls moon to tide, stone to earth—*and love to heart*! The stars themselves dancing to its tune!” He seized Merlowe’s shoulders, wild-eyed. “It’s not dust—it’s *poetry*! A play within a play!”  

“A play?” Merlowe frowned. “You’d turn physics into farce?”  

“Why not?” Shakespeare grinned. “Let mathematicians scrawl their equations! I’ll make this force *sing*. A tragicomedy—kingdoms upended by an unseen queen! Lovers torn apart by… by *gravitas*!” He paused, voice softening like dawn mist. “What if we’re all mere players on a stage… held fast by threads we cannot see?”
